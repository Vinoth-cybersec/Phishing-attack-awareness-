## Project Structure

├── email_template.txt         # Phishing email template
├── index.html                 # Phishing login page
├── capture.php                # Script to capture credentials
├── credentials.log            # Log file for captured credentials
└── thankyou.html              # Thank you page after submission
```

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Install a local server environment (e.g., XAMPP, WAMP).
   - Ensure PHP is enabled.

2. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/phishing-simulation.git
   cd phishing-simulation
   ```

3. **Setup the Server**:
   - Move the project folder to the `htdocs` directory (for XAMPP) or the equivalent for your server.
   - Start the local server.

## How It Works

1. **Phishing Email**: A crafted email is sent to users, prompting them to verify their account by clicking a link.
2. **Fake Login Page**: The link directs users to a simulated login page where they are prompted to enter their username and password.
3. **Data Capture**: Submitted credentials are captured and logged in a file (`credentials.log`).
4. **Thank You Page**: After submission, users are redirected to a thank you page.

## Usage

- Customize the phishing email template in `email_template.txt
